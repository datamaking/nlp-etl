I want to build an NLP ETL data pipeline using PySpark with the following modules: 

1. Data source module: should have the support to read the data from multiple data stores/databases like 1. hive table, 2. HDFS and local file source system (text file, HTML file, JSON file), 3. RDBMS table source. The source module should have support for 1. extract data based on one or multiple tables, if it is multiple tables, get the data for each table then perform some join operations to make single dataset(dataframe), 2. extract data based on one or multiple queries, if it is multiple queries, get the data for each query then perform some join operations to make single dataset(dataframe).
2. Preprocessing module: HTML parsing, data cleaning, stopword removal, stemming, etc.
3. Chunking module: multiple chunking strategies with a chunk smoothing process.
vector embedding creation or generation module: tfidf embedding creation, sentence embedding creation,
4. Vector embedding creation or generation module: 1. sentence embedding creation using google st5 model: should create the embedding based on single chunk or batch of chunk, 2. tfidf embedding creation. Do not use the spark-nlp library or framework. 
5. Target module for structured or relational data and vector embedding: Write the data to multiple data stores/databases like 1. Hive table, 2. HDFS and local file target system (text file, HTML file, JSON file), 3. RDBMS table target system, 4. Vector database target system (ChromDB vector database, PostgreSQL vector database, Neo4j vector database). The target module should have support for 1. full data load, 2. incremental data load.with SCD Type 2 approach and 3. incremental data load.with CDC approach.
6. Configuration module: Pipeline config and other configuration should be python class based only.
7. Logging module,
8. Exception handling module,
9. Very important to note, design a NLP ETL data pipeline such that it can be easily configured and executed with one module or multiple modules like data sources, preprocessing steps, chunking strategies, embedding methods, and target systems without modifying existing code. 
10. Very important to note, design a NLP ETL data pipeline such that each module input read from a specific intermediate persisted data source system and write module output to specific intermediate target system.
11. Write a test case for each module code using pytest python unit testing framework.
12. Create a project structure for all the above modules.
13. Create a requirements.txt with required Python packages.
14. Create a README.md file with project structure for all the above modules and step-by-step instructions on how to integrate all these files like how to package project code and use it in the spark-submit command.
15. Use these design patterns to build the enterprise grade nlp etl data pipeline,
Pipeline Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Factory Pattern, Adapter Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Chain of Responsibility, Template Method Pattern, Observer Pattern, Circuit Breaker Pattern, Configuration Pattern. Please generate the complete code for all the modules and files.
16. In this NLP ETL data pipeline is based on either one of these four department data like ADMIN or HR or FINANCE or IT HELPDESK used for processing. These four department data is stored in different tables and columns used for text processing like chunking need to refer different column names(not same column), then code has to handle these scenarios properly.
17. Execution time of each stage or module should be calculated and should provide a final report at the end of the NLP ETL data pipeline.
