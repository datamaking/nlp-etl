## Detailed Explanation of Singleton Design Pattern

1. **Definition**  
   The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

2. **Purpose and Benefits**  
   - **Controlled Access:** It limits the number of instances to one and provides a single access point, which can be useful for managing resources like database connections, logging, or configuration settings.  
   - **Global Access:** Since the instance is globally available, it can be easily accessed anywhere in the application.
   - **Lazy Initialization:** The singleton instance is typically created when it is first needed, not at program start, which can help with resource management.

3. **Real-World Examples**  
   - **Configuration Manager:** Imagine a configuration manager for an application that should read the application settings from a file. Only one configuration manager instance should exist so that all components use the same settings.
   - **Logger:** A logging service often uses a singleton so that all parts of an application log messages consistently.
   - **Database Connection Pool:** In many systems, a singleton manages connections to a database, ensuring that only one pool is created and all parts of the application reuse the same connections.

4. **How It Works**  
   - **Instance Check:** The class checks if an instance already exists.
   - **Creation on Demand:** If not, it creates one and saves it.
   - **Global Access:** Every request for the instance returns the same, unique instance.

5. **Advantages**  
   - Ensures only one instance exists, preventing unwanted duplication.
   - Reduces resource usage if creating multiple instances would be wasteful.
   - Facilitates sharing data/state across various parts of an application.

6. **Disadvantages**  
   - Can introduce global state into an application, which may lead to hidden dependencies.
   - May complicate unit testing by making it hard to isolate components.
   - If not implemented carefully in a multithreaded environment, it may lead to issues such as race conditions.

## Python Code Example for Singleton Design Pattern

Below is a complete Python code example demonstrating the Singleton design pattern using the `__new__` method approach:

```python
# singleton.py

class Singleton:
    _instance = None  # class-level attribute to hold the singleton instance

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            # Create the instance when it is first requested
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
            # Optionally, initialize any state here if needed
            print("Creating a new Singleton instance")
        else:
            print("Using existing Singleton instance")
        return cls._instance

    def __init__(self, value=None):
        # Initialization occurs for every call, so check if already initialized if needed
        # To avoid re-initializing, you might use a flag here.
        if not hasattr(self, '_initialized'):
            self.value = value
            self._initialized = True

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

    def set_value(self, new_value):
        self.value = new_value

# Testing the Singleton

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s1 = Singleton("First Instance")
    print("s1 value:", s1.get_value())
    
    s2 = Singleton("Second Instance")
    print("s2 value:", s2.get_value())
    
    # Changing value using one instance will reflect on the other
    s1.set_value("Updated Value")
    print("s1 value after update:", s1.get_value())
    print("s2 value after update:", s2.get_value())

    print("s1 is s2:", s1 is s2)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **`__new__` Method:**  
  The `__new__` method is overridden to control the creation of a new instance. It checks if an instance already exists and returns that instance if it does; otherwise, it creates a new instance.

- **`__init__` Method:**  
  The `__init__` method initializes the instance. Here, we set a flag (`_initialized`) to ensure that initialization happens only once.

- **Testing:**  
  When creating multiple objects (`s1` and `s2`), they refer to the same instance. Changing a value through one reference affects the other.

## Mermaid Process Diagram Markdown for Singleton Design Pattern

Below is the markdown containing a Mermaid diagram for the Singleton pattern process:

```markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client calls Singleton.getInstance()] --> B{Is instance created?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return existing instance]
    B -- No --> D[Create new instance]
    D --> E[Store instance in class variable]
    E --> F[Return new instance]
```
```

### Diagram Explanation

- The diagram starts with the client calling for the singleton instance.
- It then checks whether an instance has already been created.
- If yes, it returns the existing instance.
- Otherwise, it creates a new instance, stores it, and returns it.

Below is a comprehensive explanation of the Factory Method Design Pattern with real-world examples, followed by a complete Python code example and a Mermaid process diagram in Markdown.

---

## Detailed Explanation of Factory Method Design Pattern

1. **Definition**  
   The Factory Method Design Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It encapsulates object creation so that the client code need not know which specific class is instantiated.

2. **Purpose and Benefits**  
   - **Decoupling Object Creation:** It removes the dependency between client code and the concrete classes it needs to instantiate.  
   - **Improved Maintainability:** Changes in object creation (e.g., switching a class implementation) can be confined to the factory without impacting client code.  
   - **Enhanced Flexibility:** New types of objects can be introduced without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

3. **Step by Step Process**  
   - **Define an Abstract Product:** Create an interface or abstract class that outlines the common methods for a family of products.  
   - **Implement Concrete Products:** Create concrete classes that implement the abstract product interface.  
   - **Define an Abstract Creator (Factory):** Create an abstract class that declares the factory method.  
   - **Implement Concrete Creators (Factories):** Implement subclasses of the abstract factory that override the factory method to create specific concrete products.  
   - **Client Code:** Write code that uses the factory method to create objects without coupling to specific classes.

4. **Real-World Examples**  
   - **Notification Systems:** Imagine an application that sends notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications. A factory method can decide, based on user preferences or system configuration, which type of notification object to create.  
   - **Document Editors:** In a document editor application, a factory method might be used to create different types of documents (e.g., text, spreadsheet, presentation) based on user input without the editor needing to know the details of each document type.  
   - **Vehicle Manufacturing:** A vehicle factory produces cars, trucks, or motorcycles. The factory method encapsulates the instantiation logic so that specific vehicle classes can be created without the client needing to know the details.

5. **Advantages**  
   - Promotes loose coupling between client code and concrete classes.  
   - Simplifies maintenance and improves code extensibility.  
   - Provides a single point of control for object creation.

6. **Disadvantages**  
   - Introduces additional layers in the system, which might complicate the overall design when not needed.  
   - The creation process can be overly abstract, leading to less straightforward code.

## Python Code Example for Factory Method Design Pattern

Below is a complete Python code example demonstrating the Factory Method Design Pattern. In this example, we simulate a notification system where the factory creates different types of notifications based on an input parameter.

```python
# factory_method.py

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Product
class Notification(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def notify(self, message: str) -> None:
        pass

# Concrete Products
class EmailNotification(Notification):
    def notify(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"Sending email notification with message: {message}")

class SMSNotification(Notification):
    def notify(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"Sending SMS notification with message: {message}")

class PushNotification(Notification):
    def notify(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"Sending push notification with message: {message}")

# Abstract Creator
class NotificationFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_notification(self) -> Notification:
        pass

# Concrete Creators
class EmailNotificationFactory(NotificationFactory):
    def create_notification(self) -> Notification:
        return EmailNotification()

class SMSNotificationFactory(NotificationFactory):
    def create_notification(self) -> Notification:
        return SMSNotification()

class PushNotificationFactory(NotificationFactory):
    def create_notification(self) -> Notification:
        return PushNotification()

# Client code that uses the factory method
def get_notification_factory(notification_type: str) -> NotificationFactory:
    if notification_type.lower() == "email":
        return EmailNotificationFactory()
    elif notification_type.lower() == "sms":
        return SMSNotificationFactory()
    elif notification_type.lower() == "push":
        return PushNotificationFactory()
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown notification type: {notification_type}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage:
    notification_type = "email"  # Can be 'email', 'sms', or 'push'
    factory = get_notification_factory(notification_type)
    notification = factory.create_notification()
    notification.notify("Your order has been shipped!")
```

### Explanation

- **Abstract Product (`Notification`)**: Defines the common interface for notifications.
- **Concrete Products**: (`EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, `PushNotification`) are concrete implementations of the `Notification` interface.
- **Abstract Creator (`NotificationFactory`)**: Declares the `create_notification` factory method.
- **Concrete Creators**: (`EmailNotificationFactory`, `SMSNotificationFactory`, `PushNotificationFactory`) implement the factory method to return instances of the corresponding concrete notification classes.
- **Client Code**: Uses the `get_notification_factory` function to select and create a notification instance based on the provided type, without needing to know the specifics of object instantiation.

## Mermaid Process Diagram Markdown for Factory Method Design Pattern

Below is the Markdown for a Mermaid process diagram that illustrates the workflow of the Factory Method Design Pattern.

```markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client calls get_notification_factory(notification_type)]
    B[Check notification type]
    C[Return concrete NotificationFactory]
    D[Call create_notification() on factory]
    E[Concrete Notification object is created]
    F[Client calls notify(message) on Notification object]

    A --> B
    B -- "notification_type = email" --> C[EmailNotificationFactory]
    B -- "notification_type = sms" --> C[SMSNotificationFactory]
    B -- "notification_type = push" --> C[PushNotificationFactory]
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
```
```

### Diagram Explanation

- The client calls a helper function to obtain the appropriate factory based on the notification type.
- The helper function checks the notification type and returns the corresponding concrete factory.
- The client then calls the `create_notification` method on the returned factory.
- The factory creates and returns an instance of the concrete notification class.
- Finally, the client uses the created notification object to send a notification (via `notify(message)`).

## Detailed Explanation of Abstract Factory Design Pattern

1. **Definition**  
   The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It groups multiple factory methods under one umbrella so that related products can be created together.

2. **Purpose and Benefits**  
   - **Families of Products:** It is used when you need to create a group of related objects (a product family) that must be used together.
   - **Decoupling from Concrete Classes:** It keeps the client code independent from the concrete implementations, making the system more flexible and easier to extend.
   - **Consistency:** It ensures that products from the same family are compatible with one another.

3. **Step-by-Step Process**  
   - **Define Abstract Products:** Create interfaces or abstract classes for each type of product in the family.
   - **Implement Concrete Products:** Create concrete implementations for each product that belong to specific families.
   - **Define Abstract Factory:** Create an abstract factory interface declaring methods for creating each abstract product.
   - **Implement Concrete Factories:** Create concrete factory classes that implement the abstract factory interface and instantiate the appropriate concrete products.
   - **Client Code:** The client uses the abstract factory to create product objects. The client remains unaware of the exact classes being instantiated.

4. **Real-World Examples**  
   - **Cross-Platform UI Toolkits:** A UI toolkit might need to create windows, buttons, and checkboxes tailored for different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux). Each OS would have its own factory that creates a family of compatible UI components.
   - **Vehicle Manufacturing:** A vehicle manufacturer might have factories that produce different families of products—cars, trucks, and SUVs—each with specific engines, tires, and interiors that must work together.
   - **Furniture Production:** A furniture company may have factories producing families of products such as chairs and sofas designed in a consistent style (e.g., Victorian or Modern).

5. **Advantages**  
   - Promotes consistency among products.
   - Ensures that compatible products are created together.
   - Provides flexibility to add new product families without altering existing client code.

6. **Disadvantages**  
   - Can be complex to implement due to the number of classes and interfaces introduced.
   - Adding new products to the family (i.e., modifying the abstract factory) can be challenging, as it requires changes in both the abstract factory interface and all of its concrete implementations.

## Python Code Example for Abstract Factory Design Pattern

Below is a complete Python example that demonstrates the Abstract Factory pattern using a cross-platform UI toolkit scenario. In this example, we create families of UI components (Button and Checkbox) for different operating systems (Windows and Mac).

```python
# abstract_factory.py

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Products
class Button(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def paint(self) -> None:
        pass

class Checkbox(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def paint(self) -> None:
        pass

# Concrete Products for Windows
class WindowsButton(Button):
    def paint(self) -> None:
        print("Rendering a Windows-style button.")

class WindowsCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def paint(self) -> None:
        print("Rendering a Windows-style checkbox.")

# Concrete Products for macOS
class MacButton(Button):
    def paint(self) -> None:
        print("Rendering a macOS-style button.")

class MacCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def paint(self) -> None:
        print("Rendering a macOS-style checkbox.")

# Abstract Factory
class GUIFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox:
        pass

# Concrete Factories
class WindowsFactory(GUIFactory):
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        return WindowsButton()

    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox:
        return WindowsCheckbox()

class MacFactory(GUIFactory):
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        return MacButton()

    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox:
        return MacCheckbox()

# Client Code
def get_factory(os_type: str) -> GUIFactory:
    if os_type.lower() == "windows":
        return WindowsFactory()
    elif os_type.lower() == "mac":
        return MacFactory()
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown OS type: {os_type}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage: Selecting a factory based on the operating system.
    os_type = "mac"  # Change this to "windows" to test Windows components.
    factory = get_factory(os_type)
    
    # Creating products
    button = factory.create_button()
    checkbox = factory.create_checkbox()
    
    # Paint the components
    button.paint()       # Renders macOS-style button
    checkbox.paint()     # Renders macOS-style checkbox
```

### Explanation

- **Abstract Products:** The interfaces `Button` and `Checkbox` define the operations that all concrete product classes must implement.
- **Concrete Products:** Classes like `WindowsButton`, `WindowsCheckbox`, `MacButton`, and `MacCheckbox` implement the product interfaces with platform-specific behaviors.
- **Abstract Factory:** `GUIFactory` declares methods to create abstract products.
- **Concrete Factories:** `WindowsFactory` and `MacFactory` implement the factory methods to create concrete products tailored for each operating system.
- **Client Code:** The client selects the correct factory based on the operating system and uses it to create the UI components without knowing the specifics of the underlying classes.

## Mermaid Process Diagram Markdown for Abstract Factory Design Pattern

Below is the Markdown for a Mermaid process diagram that illustrates the workflow of the Abstract Factory pattern:

```markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client requests GUIFactory based on OS type]
    B{Check OS type}
    C[Return WindowsFactory]
    D[Return MacFactory]
    E[Call create_button() on factory]
    F[Call create_checkbox() on factory]
    G[Concrete Button created]
    H[Concrete Checkbox created]
    I[Client uses products]

    A --> B
    B -- "OS = Windows" --> C
    B -- "OS = Mac" --> D
    C --> E
    C --> F
    D --> E
    D --> F
    E --> G
    F --> H
    G --> I
    H --> I
```
```

### Diagram Explanation

- The client requests a GUI factory based on the operating system.
- The factory selection is made by checking the OS type.
- Depending on the result, the appropriate factory (WindowsFactory or MacFactory) is returned.
- The client then calls methods (create_button and create_checkbox) on the factory.
- The factory creates concrete products (Button and Checkbox) that are used by the client.
